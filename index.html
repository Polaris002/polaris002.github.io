<p>A song filled with new words,a cup filled with wine<br>
<p>The bower is last year's,the weather is as fine.<br>
<p>Will last year reappera as the sun on decline?<br>
<p>Deeply I sigh for the fallen flowers in vain;<br>
<p>Vaguely I seem to know the swallows come again.<br>
<p>In fragrant garden path alone I still remain.<br>

<p>一曲新词酒一杯，去年天气旧亭台。<br>
<p>夕阳西下几时回？<br>
<p>无可奈何花落去，似曾相识燕归来<br>
<p>小院香径独徘徊。<br>
