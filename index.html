A song filled with new words,a cup filled with wine
The bower is last year's,the weather is as fine.
Will last year reappera as the sun on decline?

Deeply I sigh for the fallen flowers in vain;
Vaguely I seem to know the swallows come again.
In fragrant garden path alone I still remain.

一曲新词酒一杯，去年天气旧亭台。夕阳西下几时回？
无可奈何花落去，似曾相识燕归来，小院香径独徘徊。
